# MuddyBot

This is a twitch bot I made for [MudFlaps](https://discord.com/invite/mudflaps).

See **docs/usage.md** for more information on how to use it.

## Building

Clone this repository and run `python3 -m build` in the same directory as the ***pyproject.toml*** file. 2 File will be written to in ***dist/***.

## Security

All secrets are put in config files to mitigate the risk of me accidentally committing them to the repository.
